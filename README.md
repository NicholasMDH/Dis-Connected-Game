# Dis-Connected-Game
Short 2d game I made to discuss the negative effects of overusing digital forms of communication

To run this code you will need to download Processing 2 at: https://processing.org/download/

Once you have processing installed, run the document labeled A_Maze_ing_Nick_2.pde

The program should open and you should be able to view all of the code

There should be a green play button at the top, click it to run the game
